    "StartGuide.aboutOmniCoinText2": "OmniCoin is the official \"currency\" of the OmniBazaar marketplace. By default, when you use OmniCoin or bitcoins to buy or sell in the marketplace, there is a one percent (1%) fee that is paid by the seller. This fee is divided among service providers in the OmniBazaar marketplace. It is possible to \"opt-out\" of all OmniBazaar fees.
